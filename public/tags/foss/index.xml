      <description>Here is a quick conversation between me and my friend about grub
&amp;gt; [Friend]: Hey I got this new refurbished thinkpad x230, what do you think? [[image attachment]] &amp;gt; [Me]: Looks pretty good. Time to install some obscure operating system into it. &amp;gt; [Friend]: Yeah :skull-emoji: &amp;gt; [Me]: Let me see how you set this up after you are done with all the installation and shit. &amp;gt; [Friend]: ok &amp;gt; [Friend]: [[image attachment]] &amp;gt; [Me]: Looks neat.</description>

      <description>Few weeks ago I came across this thing called a tilde on the gnulinuxindia.org website, while lurking around the web. I had zero idea about what it was about or what even is it. So in their terms it is
An India-based shared unix system which focuses on mutual development of skills and sharing of ideas. Services are secondary in this tilde, community is prime.

      <title>Neovim Customization</title>

      <description>Why use vim and neovim over other text editors and IDEs? For me, I&amp;rsquo;ve always loved minimalism and performance over ease of use and other flashy bloat no one really uses and cares about. This why I personally use Terminal-based text editors. Preferably VIM or Neovim. Tho I currently, am running Neovim, but both of them are basically the same. NeoVIM is a little bit more extensible than VIM and easy to manage imo.</description>
