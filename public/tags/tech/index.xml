      <description>In this we will be creating a spam filter using a Raspberry Pi to remove all the incoming spam messages.&#xA;This assumes that you already have a fully working Raspberry Pi with any of the Linux distros available with Systemd as an init service. Note:&#xA;This only works for unmonitored clients such as thunderbird and other offline FOSS applications. I have not tried it on online email clients like Gmail and other proprietary spying websites.</description>

      <description>The use of AI technology in education is rapidly growing, and chatbots like ChatGPT are becoming increasingly popular as tools to assist students with their homework and assignments.

      <description>Few weeks ago I came across this thing called a tilde on the gnulinuxindia.org website, while lurking around the web. I had zero idea about what it was about or what even is it.

Services are secondary in this tilde, community is prime.&#xA;&amp;ndash; Tildevarsh&#xA;Still confused watch this Video</description>
