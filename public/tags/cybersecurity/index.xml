      <description>In this we will be creating a spam filter using a Raspberry Pi to remove all the incoming spam messages.&#xA;This assumes that you already have a fully working Raspberry Pi with any of the Linux distros available with Systemd as an init service. Note:&#xA;This only works for unmonitored clients such as thunderbird and other offline FOSS applications. I have not tried it on online email clients like Gmail and other proprietary spying websites.</description>

      <description>Disclaimer: This is for educational purposes, do not abuse this method. Developers can often struggle to find the data they need for their personal projects due to certain services locking down their API‚Äôs.&#xA;So I wanted to show you a way you can get the data you need.&#xA;What is MITM Proxy and how does it work? MITM stands for Man-in-the-Middle and mitmproxy is exactly that. It allows you to send data through a proxy that acts as a man-in-the-middle so you can read the request and responses being sent to and from the server.</description>
