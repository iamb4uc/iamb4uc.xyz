<p><em><strong>Neon-Genesis Evangalion</strong></em><br>
One of my most favorite anime of all time, it was one of the first anime that made me interested in <strong>serious topics</strong> such as mental health, trauma in an ANIME. It is very rare to see good quality anime these days. But if you are a sucker for good plot and short anime that wont take too much dedication to watch through like me you will love this one.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em><strong>Cyberpunk Edgerunners</strong></em><br>
I just finished this anime just the day it was released. An man it was short but packed with an engaging story, at least for me(<del>who still regrets buying the game</del>). It doesn&rsquo;t have a normal ending and would probably don&rsquo;t want a sequel. But its worth the watch. Trust me you will like this.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em><strong>Berserk</strong></em><br>
When it comes to some big ass motherfucker killing everyone with a big ass sword, and it fulfills all that perfectly. Tho I prefer reading the manga instead of the shitty animation but if you just want to watch the anime then go for it, it is <em><strong>ok</strong></em> nothing more than that.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em><strong>Code gease</strong></em><br>
The god of actual perfect ending in an anime series, just watch it in your free time and trust me you will at-least appreciate how good the ending is compared to some modern cringe.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em><strong>Dororo</strong></em>:<br>
If you like non-stop action with a very unique story. Dororo is for you, it has so much action yet it maintains a decent story without being too over the top.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em><strong>Samurai Champloo</strong></em>:<br>
One of the best og action series and a masterpiece of a story, will definitely recommend to both normal people and cringy degenerate weeb that only know about shonen and isekai shit.</p>
