  <h1>GRUB - *Literally for coomies*</h1>

  <p>Here is a quick conversation between me and my friend about grub</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>&gt; [Friend]: Hey I got this new refurbished thinkpad
            x230, what do you think? [[image attachment]]
&gt; [Me]: Looks pretty good. Time to install some
        obscure operating system into it.
&gt; [Friend]: Yeah :skull-emoji:
&gt; [Me]: Let me see how you set this up after you
        are done with all the installation and shit.
&gt; [Friend]: ok


&gt; [Friend]: [[image attachment]]
&gt; [Me]: Looks neat.
&gt; [Friend]: thanks
&gt; [Me]: What software you are using?
&gt; [Friend]: Artix Linux with a WM.
&gt; [Me]: And the bootloader?
&gt; [Friend]: grub. duh!

*BLOCKED*

But I do hate grub from the bottom of my heart,
even gummiboot is better than what grub offers.
Here are some reasons why:</p>
<ul>
<li>It&rsquo;s an operating system in itself</li>
<li>The code base for this &ldquo;bootloader&rdquo; is larger than some actual utilities people use</li>
<li>Bloated af.</li>
<li>Tries to do everything just like systemd.</li>
</ul>
<p>I generally avoid grub but in linux is basically
the default option besides some systemd distros
that come with gummiboot or some derivative of that
like the d*** systemd-boot.</p>
<p>I generally use the base gummiboot if I am on linux
and libreboot on devices that supports free software.</p>
<p>The sad thing is there are no good bootloader that
does what the name says and nothing more, and we
are stuck with this barrage of malware like
systemd, grub in our systems.</p>
<p>I wont hate you if you just use grub or systemd
-boot but you should check out some other
alternatives.</p>
