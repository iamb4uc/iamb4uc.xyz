    <h1>Lets Join Tilde Varsh</h1>

    <p>Few weeks ago I came across this thing called a tilde on the <a href="https://gnulinuxindia.org">gnulinuxindia.org</a> website, while lurking around the web. I had zero idea about what it was about or what even is it. So in their terms it is</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An India-based shared unix system which focuses on mutual development of skills and sharing of ideas. Services are secondary in this tilde, community is prime.</p>
<p>&ndash;<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Tildevarsh<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Still confused watch this <a href="https://yewtu.be/watch?v=qK1mInnbfrU">Video</a></p>
<p>If you want to join too you can fill up this form with your email and other details <a href="https://tildevarsh.in/register">here</a> and have fun with your new UNIX system.</p>
<h4 id="step-by-step-guide">Step-By-Step Guide</h4>
<ol>
<li>Enter you username, email address of choice in the &ldquo;Username&rdquo; and the &ldquo;You email (Need one so we can contact you):&rdquo; field.</li>
<li>Enter you pre-existing ssh(public)key.</li>
<li>If you dont have one then lets create a new one using the following commands.</li>
</ol>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#000;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span style="display:flex;"><span>ssh-keygen
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>After that you would be prompted by the following:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#000;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span style="display:flex;"><span>Generating public/private rsa key pair.
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>Enter file in which to save the key (/home/username/.ssh/id_rsa):
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This will create a new file and a directory in <code>$XDG_HOME_DIR/.ssh</code>. After that, you would be prompted for a password for a key. <strong>It is very important that you make a hard password since it will be used for you to login to the machine and for any other future logins</strong><br>
After completing you will get some form of ASCII art for confirmation.<br>
Now copy and paste the contents of <code>$XDG_HOME_DIR/.ssh/id_rsa.pub</code> to the public key field in the form.</p>
<p>Finally after finishing wait for ~24hrs and you will receive an email with your login credentials.</p>
<p>After your first login with the default credentials, change your password for your account.</p>
<p><strong>REMEMBER DO NOT STORE ANYTHING PERSONAL IN THESE MACHINES AS IT IS A MULTIUSER SYSTEM</strong></p>
<p>You can create a free website in the <code>public_html</code> directory.
Also dont forget to visit my tilde at <a href="https://b4uc.tildevarsh.in/">~b4uc</a></p>
