  <h1>Ghost Mode</h1>

  <p><em>Ghost mode is the act of going complete offline
and returning as the best version of yourself. It
does not mean that you need to be rude or tell
everyone to follow what you are doing.</em></p>
<p>Here is the complete guide of how to get your life
together and <strong>GRIND</strong> MOTHERFUCKER.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Delete everything that keeps you on your phone:</strong><br>
Limit the time you spend
on social media each day, or better yet don&rsquo;t use
them. You don&rsquo;t really need them. You are just
afraid of <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Fomo">fomo</a>,
even if you say something like: &ldquo;Well I need to
talk to my friends and family so, I need all these
social media.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s not a reasonable thing to say,
since the family member who really need to contact
you can just call you. Same goes for your friends,
no one texts when its urgent so why even use text.
Focus on yourself without watching what other
people are doing with their life and imitate them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Get used to being <em>&ldquo;bored&rdquo;</em>:</strong><br>
One of the most common thing I hear when I talk
about how I live, is this &ldquo;you sure are boring man&rdquo;,
I mean yeah but why does it have to be a bad thing,
when you are bored you are the most creative, you
can come up with stuff like new projects ideas,
just to stay out of that boredom. Life is much more
beautiful when you come out of that boredom without
using something like smartphone. Maybe call a
friend you haven&rsquo;t been in touch with for
sometimes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Realize that no one cares for you:</strong><br>
When you do this, at first you might get a little
depressed so take with a grain of salt, but for me
when I think that no one care for what I do or
who I am, I can be who I want to be without the
fear of being judged. I can think about unorthodox
stuff without feeling like someone is gonna have
some sort of emotional response. Like for real
tho I made this website and never thought of
getting any response. But well I do get some which
are nice. <strong>Don&rsquo;t get confused with isolating
yourself, I just mean keeping your distance from
other from time to time</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Practice Mindfulness</strong>:<br>
This is the most common thing I see when I read
about self-care and other bullshit article which
are just cookie cutter shit for everyone. But I do
agree with some of it, here are some of the stuff I
do and find having some impact on my life:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do physical training, it may be resistance
training, cardio(if you are a chungus).<br>
In short, <em>get jacked as fuck and all your problems will dissolve.</em></li>
<li>Guided meditations (<em>you can use an app like
<a href="https://meditofoundation.org/medito-app">medito</a>
its completely open source, so I prefer it over
other shitty meditation apps</em>).</li>
<li>Journal everything that comes to your mind. For
me, I write two journals, one for everything I will
be doing that day and one that has all my
gratitude which I write 2-3times a week and
keeping a track of all these are good for your
mental health and makes you more humble. Trust me
you will find more joy in living life when you
realize how many things you have in life that you
never realized when you just compare yourself to
other people.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Well these are all I can think of right now, I
don&rsquo;t want to spend more time writing this lol.</p>
<p><strong>JUST REMEMBER THIS</strong></p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no one-size-fits-all solution for this kind
of stuff. Just take things one step at a time, and
you&rsquo;ll be on your way to living a happier,
healthier life offline in no time! This is not a
race, it&rsquo;s about being better today than what you
were yesterday</p>
