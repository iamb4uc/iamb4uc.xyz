  <h1>On Social Media</h1>

  <p>Last day I got this email and here what it reads:</p>
<blockquote>

and would appreciate your insights on the following
points:</p>

<p>Positive aspects: What do you consider the main

<p>So firstly your email feels like AI generated not
gonna lie. Secondly, that&rsquo;s a long ass mail, and
most importantly <strong>WOMAN HAS GOOD QUESTION</strong>.</p>
<p>The very short answer to this is &lsquo;<strong>DON&rsquo;T USE SOCIAL
MEDIA BESIDES MESSAGING APPS HECK DON&rsquo;T EVEN USE
THOSE</strong>&rsquo;. If you understand what I mean by just
this, you don&rsquo;t need to read the rest.</p>
<p>Now, I am no professional at this, I just don&rsquo;t
need social media. Therefore, I don&rsquo;t use social
media. Also, social media takes me away from the
core virtues.</p>
<p>So, here is why I hate social media and what I
think about it.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Social media especially the once that are owned
by a centralized corporation and are not federated
are a massive shit-show. These apps/website don&rsquo;t
care about your privacy, security or heck even your
basic rights such as right to speech.<br>
Your posts are all good unless you criticize
something, post something that is not normal in
terms of politics, ethics, moral, and other stuff
I don&rsquo;t know about.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>People who use social media are rude annoying
dickheads, I mean if you can&rsquo;t really sit in one
place without checking their phone for some random
shit that is not that important.<br>
To be more clear I do carry a phone to public place
to stay connected with my family and urgent shit
and that only for phone calls. I don&rsquo;t really use
any social media on my phone, I just use it to take
group photos and phone calls, hack I don&rsquo;t event use
email on my phone.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These are the main two reason I hate, since I never
used social media, I don&rsquo;t know much about how can
it impact your personal life. Tho one thing in my
opinion that&rsquo;s keeping people from going complete
offline, is the fact of FOMO as I have said in my
last post. Its just keeps up coming when I talk
about things related to this topic to my friends.
One of the common quote from all of them is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What if someone needs to talk to me and it&rsquo;s
urgent?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>First of all, If they need to talk to you for
something urgent, they can call, come to your house
or even tell someone to call on their behalf. That&rsquo;s
the fastest way to get in touch with someone.</p>
<p>At the end it does not matter, what the case is for
you but the fact that people need to ask for
advice/opinion on this basic thing you are already
sucked deep into this toxic social media thing.</p>
<hr>
<p>Anyways, to end this I will say this:</p>
<p><em>YOU DONT NEED SOCIAL MEDIA TO</em></p>
<ul>
<li>BE HAPPY,</li>
<li>HAVE A GOOD LIFE,</li>
<li>HAVE A CARING FAMILY,</li>
<li>HAVE STRONG FRIENDSHIP<br>
OR EVEN FIND THE LOVE OF YOUR LIFE. (SORRY IF THIS IS CORNY, I AM LISTENING TO SOME JAZZ RIGHT NOW)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>The only thing that matters is the fact that you
stay away from all these things and get better at
other really life interactions and other social
behaviors, its not about improving, its just going
back to your basic social norms and maintaining
these and being a good role model to people around
you.</em></p>
<p>Well that&rsquo;s all for this post, go do some work now.
Also email me about things you liked or hated about
these kinds of response blog. Just don&rsquo;t use AI to
write these mail, I won&rsquo;t respond.</p>
