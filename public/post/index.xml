      <description>Few weeks ago I came across this thing called a tilde on the gnulinuxindia.org website, while lurking around the web. I had zero idea about what it was about or what even is it. So in their terms it is
An India-based shared unix system which focuses on mutual development of skills and sharing of ideas. Services are secondary in this tilde, community is prime.

&amp;ndash;Dr Aust

Its not just black and white, good or bad. I have mixed feeling but i am optimistic about this.
TOC The bad part The good part The bad part It not that medicine is evil, we all need them to live a healthy and less stressful life. Its the medicine companies or as every social media influencer puts it &amp;ldquo;BIG PHARMA&amp;rdquo; I hate.</description>

      <title>Neovim Customization</title>

      <description>Why use vim and neovim over other text editors and IDEs? For me, I&amp;rsquo;ve always loved minimalism and performance over ease of use and other flashy bloat no one really uses and cares about. This why I personally use Terminal-based text editors. Preferably VIM or Neovim. Tho I currently, am running Neovim, but both of them are basically the same. NeoVIM is a little bit more extensible than VIM and easy to manage imo.</description>
