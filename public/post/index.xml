      <description>In this we will be creating a spam filter using a Raspberry Pi to remove all the incoming spam messages.&#xA;This assumes that you already have a fully working Raspberry Pi with any of the Linux distros available with Systemd as an init service. Note:&#xA;This only works for unmonitored clients such as thunderbird and other offline FOSS applications. I have not tried it on online email clients like Gmail and other proprietary spying websites.</description>

      <description>Disclaimer: This is for educational purposes, do not abuse this method. Developers can often struggle to find the data they need for their personal projects due to certain services locking down their API‚Äôs.&#xA;So I wanted to show you a way you can get the data you need.&#xA;What is MITM Proxy and how does it work? MITM stands for Man-in-the-Middle and mitmproxy is exactly that. It allows you to send data through a proxy that acts as a man-in-the-middle so you can read the request and responses being sent to and from the server.</description>

      <description>The use of AI technology in education is rapidly growing, and chatbots like ChatGPT are becoming increasingly popular as tools to assist students with their homework and assignments. However, this trend has not been without controversy. Recently, it was reported that the state of New York has banned the use of chatbots like ChatGPT in schools, due to concerns about their potential misuse by students.&#xA;The decision to ban chatbots in New York schools was made after it was reported that some students were using these tools to cheat on their homework and assignments.</description>

      <description>Stoicism has been a guiding principle in my life for the past few years. It has helped me to navigate through difficult times and find inner peace and fulfillment. The concept of &amp;ldquo;ataraxia&amp;rdquo; or inner peace, has been particularly valuable to me. Accepting that some things are beyond our control and focusing on the things that are within our control has allowed me to let go of my attachment to certain outcomes and find peace in the present moment.</description>

      <description>Few weeks ago I came across this thing called a tilde on the gnulinuxindia.org website, while lurking around the web. I had zero idea about what it was about or what even is it. So in their terms it is&#xA;An India-based shared unix system which focuses on mutual development of skills and sharing of ideas. Services are secondary in this tilde, community is prime.&#xA;&amp;ndash; Tildevarsh&#xA;Still confused watch this Video</description>

      <title>Neovim Customization</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/post/nvim-customization/</link>

      <description>Why use vim and neovim over other text editors and IDEs? For me, I&amp;rsquo;ve always loved minimalism and performance over ease of use and other flashy bloat no one really uses and cares about. This why I personally use Terminal-based text editors. Preferably VIM or Neovim. Tho I currently, am running Neovim, but both of them are basically the same. NeoVIM is a little bit more extensible than VIM and easy to manage imo.</description>
