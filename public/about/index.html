<p>Hello and welcome to my personal website! My name is Swapnil(a.k.a. B4UC),
and I am currently a Computer Science and Applications student with a passion for all thing
technology. I have a particular interest in Free and Open-Source software,
Cybersecurity, Computer networks, and Virtualization technologies. With my
background in Computer Science, I have been able to develop a strong foundation
in programming and problem-solving, which I apply to all my projects.</p>
<p>My passion for Free and Open-Source software began when I discovered the power
and flexibility it offers in comparison to proprietary software. I have been
actively involved in several Free and Open-Source projects and have contributed
to various communities. I am always looking for opportunities to learn more
and gain experience in this field.</p>
<p>In addition to Free and Open-Source software, I am also fascinated by the
field of Cybersecurity. I believe that with the increasing digitization of
our world, cybersecurity is becoming more important than ever. I am actively
studying different cybersecurity techniques and strategies, and I am always
eager to learn more.</p>
<p>Computer networks and Virtualization technologies are also areas of
great interest to me. I am fascinated by the way that different computers
and devices can be connected and how virtualization technologies can be
used to create efficient and flexible computing environments. I am
always looking for opportunities to learn more about these topics and
to gain hands-on experience.</p>
<p>Overall, my goal is to use my skills and knowledge to make a positive
impact in the technology industry. On my website, you can find more
information about my background, my professional experience, and my
current projects. Thank you for visiting, and I hope you find something
of interest here.</p>
<p>Besides technology, I do <em><strong>enjoy</strong></em> movies, music, anime, and books like a
regular person, but won&rsquo;t even try to bring that up in a conversation unless
someone genuinely asks me to. But if you are interested, you can check out my
recommendations bellow:</p>
