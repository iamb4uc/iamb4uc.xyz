  <p><img src="/img/bocchi-the-rock.gif" alt="Header"></p>
<p>I am a systems-level engineer with a passion for
UNIX-like operating systems as well as other
Free-and-Open-source software and a knack for hardware
tinkering. I love digging into low-level details to
understand how things really work, and using that
knowledge to build robust, reliable software.
Whether it&rsquo;s optimizing performance, improving
security, or just exploring new possibilities, I&rsquo;m
always looking for ways to push the boundaries of
what&rsquo;s possible with code. Follow me for projects
and insights on all things systems and hardware!</p>
<p>Besides technology, I do <strong><em>enjoy</em></strong> movies, music,
anime, and books like a regular person, but won&rsquo;t
even try to bring that up in a conversation unless
someone genuinely asks me to. But if you are
interested, you can check out my recommendations
