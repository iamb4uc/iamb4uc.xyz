      <description>The use of AI technology in education is rapidly growing, and chatbots like ChatGPT are becoming increasingly popular as tools to assist students with their homework and assignments. However, this trend has not been without controversy. Recently, it was reported that the state of New York has banned the use of chatbots like ChatGPT in schools, due to concerns about their potential misuse by students.
The decision to ban chatbots in New York schools was made after it was reported that some students were using these tools to cheat on their homework and assignments.</description>

      <description>Stoicism has been a guiding principle in my life for the past few years. It has helped me to navigate through difficult times and find inner peace and fulfillment. The concept of &amp;ldquo;ataraxia&amp;rdquo; or inner peace, has been particularly valuable to me. Accepting that some things are beyond our control and focusing on the things that are within our control has allowed me to let go of my attachment to certain outcomes and find peace in the present moment.</description>

      <description>Few weeks ago I came across this thing called a tilde on the gnulinuxindia.org website, while lurking around the web. I had zero idea about what it was about or what even is it. So in their terms it is
An India-based shared unix system which focuses on mutual development of skills and sharing of ideas. Services are secondary in this tilde, community is prime.

      <title>Neovim Customization</title>

      <description>Why use vim and neovim over other text editors and IDEs? For me, I&amp;rsquo;ve always loved minimalism and performance over ease of use and other flashy bloat no one really uses and cares about. This why I personally use Terminal-based text editors. Preferably VIM or Neovim. Tho I currently, am running Neovim, but both of them are basically the same. NeoVIM is a little bit more extensible than VIM and easy to manage imo.</description>

      <description>Neon-Genesis Evangalion
One of my most favorite anime of all time, it was one of the first anime that made me interested in serious topics such as mental health, trauma in an ANIME. It is very rare to see good quality anime these days. But if you are a sucker for good plot and short anime that wont take too much dedication to watch through like me you will love this one.</description>
