Philosophy is not just about talking or lecturing, or even reading long, dense
books. In fact, it is something men and women of action use -- and have used
throughout history -- to solve their problems and achieve their greatest
triumphs. Not in the classroom, but on the battlefield, in the Forum, and at
court.

As Thoreau put it, "to be a philosopher is not merely to have subtle thoughts,
nor even to found a school...it is to solve some of the problems of life, not
only theoretically, but practically."

That kind of philosophy has been jotted down (and practiced) by slaves, poets,
emperors, politicians and soldiers, as well as ordinary folks to help with
their own problems and those of their friends, family and followers for
thousands of years. This wisdom is still there, available to us.

Now here comes stoicism, it is one of the most practical philosophical ideas.

Stoicism was founded in Athens by Zeno of Citium in the early 3rd century BC,
but was famously practiced by the likes of 
[Epictetus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epictetus),
[Cato](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cato_the_Younger),
[Seneca](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seneca_the_Younger) and
[Marcus Aurelius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Aurelius).
The philosophy asserts that virtue (such as wisdom) is happiness and
judgment should be based on behavior, rather than words. That we donâ€™t control
and cannot rely on external events, only ourselves and our responses.

One of my most favourite quotes from stoic philosopher 
[Epictetus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epictetus)

>In life our first job is this, to divide and distinguish things into two 
catagories: external I cannot control, but the choices I make with regard to 
them I do control. Where will I find good or bad? In me, in my choices."
