### The bad part
It not that medicine is evil, we all need them to live a healthy and less stressful life. Its the medicine companies or as every social media influencer puts it "**BIG PHARMA**" I hate. To a normal person who sits behind a screen just consuming media that is not a big issue until they or someone
else suffers from these companies directly or indirectly.  
These companies, most of the time make patients depended on its patients, which they claim is not the case but, you can try for you self. Just get a medicine like a pill that fixed stomach issues, after taking the medicine for some time your body gets so dialed in that it starts relying on that
specific drug to its job.  This in itself is a big issue even for this small kind of drugs. Making you patients completely dependent on you drug is one of the most inhumane thing a company can do to its client/users.  
Another of the most widely spoken critique of big pharma is the fact that drug prices in some part of the world is way too much than normal. Especially countries like United States, Canada, face such high drug prizes which lead people to go in debt in order to buy fucking medicine. Like Jesus
fucking Christ, who the fuck stole their money that they are charging to all these innocent people, just imagine your grandma or your parent die cause you cant afford fucking medicine.  

Its so absurd that a dingus like me looses his temper when writing this blog.  

Whenever a new company tries to make a cheap alternative medicine to that overly priced maggot shit, it get sued so fucking hard even their deaf grandma can hear them. All these and the fucking government doesn't understand that they are breaking every single anti-trust law they lay their eye upon.
Its like weird fetish of their.

### The good part
These medicine company put in quite a lot of work in making a new drug for a new disease.  Some of these are very crucial drugs that help people fight life-threatening diseases.  
This part might not be as rant-y as the bad part but I cant emphasis this enough, due to these medicine companies, we all have the life we have, look at the time when their were no big pharma, if a person had caught something like the bubonic plague which is easily curable by a antibiotic medicine
at this time, wiped 1/3rd of the world population. So we gotta be thankful for people who put in so much work in order to make our life a bit better.
