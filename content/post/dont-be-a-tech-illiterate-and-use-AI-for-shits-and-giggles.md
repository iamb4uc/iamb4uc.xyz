        Guys using AI without even knowing what the actual fuck it is. btw <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3e/Pig_farm_Vampula_1.jpg">img source</a>

If you're one of those people out there using some LLM to generate a *deranged
cartoon version of your real images*, this is your intervention. Like **SIT THE
FUCK DOWN AND TOUCH SOME FUCKING GRASS**.

Just cause you figured out how to type "*make me look like a Disney princess
with fucking abs and J cup tiddies*" doesn't mean you suddenly understand tech.
You barely understand how to update your fucking apps, but here you are,
raw-dogging your biometric data into some sketchy AI tool like it's no big
deal.

You treat AI like its a Photoshop with vibes, but in reality, you're just the
world's dumbest unpaid data supplier. This isn’t a camera filter from 2010.
This is a machine designed to consume, learn, and use what you give it. And
you're handing out your identity like it's a fucking free samples at some
grocery shop.

If you don't know what data retention is, shut the fuck up about how "*AI is the
future.*" You’re not riding the wave. You are the wave - the wave of reckless
morons flooding servers with selfies, anime dreams, and zero self-awareness.
And tbh no body wants to see your pictures even if you generate yourself a pair
of triple D jugs. So STFU and go do something interesting.
