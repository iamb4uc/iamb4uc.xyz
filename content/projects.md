### [_Dotfiles_](https://github.com/iamb4uc/dots.git)

These dotfiles are very crucial to my development
process and are a bonus for anyone who like to use
vim/neovim and some other terminal applications. If
you want to see for you yourself head over to the
repo and clone it. Also feel free to improve the
existing or creating new solutions to problems in
that repo.

### [_No-More-Style-Please_](https://github.com/iamb4uc/no-more-style-please.git)

A Hugo theme that is made to look super minimal,
yet modern.

### [_Dynamic Window Manager_](https://github.com/iamb4uc/dwm.git)

A port of [https://suckless.org](https://suckless.org)s
dwm, which is a minimal standalone window manager
that is super customizable without hogging much
system resources.
