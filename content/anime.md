1. ***Neon-Genesis Evangalion***  
One of my most favorite anime of all time, it was one of the first anime that made me interested in **serious topics** such as mental health, trauma in an ANIME. It is very rare to see good quality anime these days. But if you are a sucker for good plot and short anime that wont take too much dedication to watch through like me you will love this one.

2. ***Cyberpunk Edgerunners***  
I just finished this anime just the day it was released. An man it was short but packed with an engaging story, at least for me(~~who still regrets buying the game~~). It doesn't have a normal ending and would probably don't want a sequel. But its worth the watch. Trust me you will like this.  

3. ***Berserk***  
When it comes to some big ass motherfucker killing everyone with a big ass sword, and it fulfills all that perfectly. Tho I prefer reading the manga instead of the shitty animation but if you just want to watch the anime then go for it, it is ***ok*** nothing more than that.  

4. ***Code gease***  
The god of actual perfect ending in an anime series, just watch it in your free time and trust me you will at-least appreciate how good the ending is compared to some modern cringe.  

5. ***Dororo***:  
If you like non-stop action with a very unique story. Dororo is for you, it has so much action yet it maintains a decent story without being too over the top.

5. ***Samurai Champloo***:  
One of the best og action series and a masterpiece of a story, will definitely recommend to both normal people and cringy degenerate weeb that only know about shonen and isekai shit.
