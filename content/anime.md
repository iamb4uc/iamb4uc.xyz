[Disclaimer]  
> I am no weeb or otaku, just a regular anime watcher and I deeply despise people who indulge in such low life shit, I don't hate people who keep their shit within a specific boundary but if you are a self-proclaimed weeb/otaku please go kill yourself  

A list of definitely not-cringe anime/manga.
1. ***Neon-Genesis Evangalion***  
  One of my most favourite anime of all time, it was one of the first anime that made me interested in **serious topics** such as mental health, trauma in an ANIME. It is very rare to see good quality anime these days. But if you are a sucker for good plot and short anime that wont take too much
  dedication to watch through like me you will love this one.

2. ***Cyberpunk Edgerunners***  
  I just finished this anime just the day it was released. An man it was short but packed with an engaging story, at least for me(~~who still regrets buying the game~~). It doesn't have a normal ending and would probably don't want a sequel. But its worth the watch. Trust me you will like this.  

3. ***Berserk***  
  I all down when it comes to some big motherfucker killing everyone with a big ass sword, and it fulfills all that perfectly. Tho I prefer reading the manga instead of the shitty animation but if you just want to watch the anime then go for it, it is ***ok*** nothing more than that.  

4. ***Code gease***  
  The god of actual perfect ending in an anime series, just watch it in your free time and trust me you will at-least appreciate how good the ending is compared to some modern cringe.
