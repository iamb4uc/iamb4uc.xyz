**Hey there! I'm Swapnil, an aspiring programmer and cybersecurity student who loves diving into UNIX-like operating systems and other Free-and-Open-source software. I'm also a bit of a hardware tinkerer, though my budget doesn't always allow for big projects (*sigh*). I enjoy getting into the nitty-gritty of how things work and using that knowledge to build solid, reliable software. Whether it's boosting performance, enhancing security, or just exploring new tech, I'm always up for pushing the limits of what's possible with code.**

When I'm not knee-deep in code, Iâ€™m working on improving other aspects of my life, like my social and financial skills. If I'm not coding, I'm usually busy with self-improvement projects. I might even share my routine someday, so feel free to subscribe to my [RSS](/index.xml) feed.

Outside of tech, I'm into movies, music, anime, and books. I don't usually bring these up unless someone asks, but if you're curious, check out my recommendations below:
