# About Me
Hello there!, I am a Computer Science and Application student that
specializes in back-end technologies and free and open source applications.
I use free and open source applications and do encourage other to get
themselves liberated from the proprietary and tracker-filled ***soyware*** 
that they have been using for years.

But besides that I love tinkering with *any-tech* related. From customizing
my knowledge about different programming language, markup language to
physically changing the configuration of my computer and servers. Its just a
good way to spend time while learning something new.

Besides technology, I do ***enjoy*** movies, music, anime, and books like a
regular person, but won't even try to bring that up in a conversation unless
someone genuinely asks me to. But if you are interested, you can checkout my
recommendations bellow:

## *Software I use and recommend*
### Priorities
The software should be as lightweight as possible and can be easily
customizeable, which means it is fast as fuck without compromising much. I 
dont care about flasy features or over the top design. I want a software
can transfer the things in my mind into some sort of file, without much 
hastle.

I like having vim/vim-like keybindings and prefer terminal program over
others. That said, I am not a "*terminal is cooler*" kid, that is just pure
cringe. There is somethings in my opinion ofc that graphical program does 
better than its terminal alternatives.

Anyways, here are the programs I use

**Operating System**  
In general I use [void linux](https://voidlinux.org), which is an
independent distrobution of
GNU/Linux. I like the runnit init system and the xbps package manager it
provides, its fast and minimal even on old hardware.


**Terminal**  
I use the [suckless terminal](https://st.suckless.org/) which is a very
minimal yet customizeable terminal emulator. It is simply the best for my use
case.


**Shell**  
I use dash and zsh on my machine, tho I write most of my shell scripts for 
POSIX complient shell I use zsh sometimes for its customizeablity although
I really hate the bloated 'oh-my-zsh' framework is utter garbage and a pure 
example of how not to write plugins/framework for something.


**Window Manager/Desktop Environment**  
I use suckless' [Dynamic Window Manager(DWM)](https://dwm.suckless.org) its a
extreamly lightweight and fast asf window manager. I prefer window managers 
over desktop environments cause all my needs are fulfilled by my dwm config.
I also use my own build of slstatus from the suckless guys as my status 
manager.


**IDE/Text Editor**  
I use Neovim, although I used to use just vim but I really like the native 
lua support that Neovim provides out of the box and also the auto completion
LSP support. Tho I know my neovim config is a bit bloated with all the plugins
I use but I have to use some of it cause of my workflow.


**Web Browser**  
I use two browsers, I use librewolf as my main browser, and TOR for anything
I dont want people to know about.


**File Manager**  
I use lf file manager. It is a terminal based file manager that uses vim-like
keybindings.


**Music Player**  
I use ncmpcpp with mpd for anything audio related.


**Video Player**  
mpv is the best video player in my oppinion and you are an idiot if you say I 
am wrong.
