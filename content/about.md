**Hello, I am Swapnil, an aspiring systems programmer with a passion for UNIX-like operating systems as well as other Free-and-Open-source software and a knack for hardware tinkering, tho I am on a limit for that since I am broke. I love digging into low-level details to understand how things really work, and using that knowledge to build robust, reliable software. Whether it's optimizing performance, improving security, or just exploring new possibilities, I'm always looking for ways to push the boundaries of what's possible with code.**

Besides technology, I like improving myself in other aspects of life, like my social life and financial life. If I am not writing code, I am usually busy with improving myself, I might make my routine public one day so better subscribe to my [RSS](/index.xml) feed.

All that aside, I do enjoy movies, music, anime, and books like a regular person, but won't even try to bring that up in a conversation unless someone genuinely asks me to. But if you are interested, you can check out my recommendations bellow:
