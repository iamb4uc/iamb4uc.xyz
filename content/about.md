I am a systems-level engineer with a passion for
UNIX-like operating systems as well as other
Free-and-Open-source software and a knack for hardware
tinkering. I love digging into low-level details to
understand how things really work, and using that
knowledge to build robust, reliable software.
Whether it's optimizing performance, improving
security, or just exploring new possibilities, I'm
always looking for ways to push the boundaries of
what's possible with code. Follow me for projects
and insights on all things systems and hardware!

Besides technology, I do **_enjoy_** movies, music,
anime, and books like a regular person, but won't
even try to bring that up in a conversation unless
someone genuinely asks me to. But if you are
interested, you can check out my recommendations
bellow:

- [Anime/Manga](/anime/)
- [Books](/book/)
