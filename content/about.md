Hello, I am Swapnil, a wanna-be systems-level
engineer with a passion for UNIX-like operating
systems as well as other Free-and-Open-source
software and a knack for hardware tinkering. I love
digging into low-level details to understand how
things really work, and using that knowledge to
build robust, reliable software. Whether it's
optimizing performance, improving security, or just
exploring new possibilities, I'm always looking for
ways to push the boundaries of what's possible with
code.

Besides technology, I like improving myself in
other aspects of life, like my social life and
financial life. If I am not writing code, I am usually busy with improving myself, I might make my routine public one day so better subscribe to my [RRS](/index.xml) feed.

All that aside, I do enjoy movies, music,
anime, and books like a regular person, but won't
even try to bring that up in a conversation unless
someone genuinely asks me to. But if you are
interested, you can check out my recommendations
bellow:

- [Anime/Manga](/anime/)
- [Books](/book/)
