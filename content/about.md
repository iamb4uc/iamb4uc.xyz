# About Me
Hello and welcome to my personal website! My name is Swapnil(a.k.a. B4UC), and I am currently a Computer Science student with a passion for all things technology. I have a particular interest in Free and Open-Source software, Cybersecurity, Computer networks, and Virtualization technologies. With my background in Computer Science, I have been able to develop a strong foundation in programming and problem-solving, which I apply to all my projects.

My passion for Free and Open-Source software began when I discovered the power and flexibility it offers in comparison to proprietary software. I have been actively involved in several Free and Open-Source projects and have contributed to various communities. I am always looking for opportunities to learn more and gain experience in this field.

In addition to Free and Open-Source software, I am also fascinated by the field of Cybersecurity. I believe that with the increasing digitization of our world, cybersecurity is becoming more important than ever. I am actively studying different cybersecurity techniques and strategies, and I am always eager to learn more.

Computer networks and Virtualization technologies are also areas of great interest to me. I am fascinated by the way that different computers and devices can be connected and how virtualization technologies can be used to create efficient and flexible computing environments. I am always looking for opportunities to learn more about these topics and to gain hands-on experience.

Overall, my goal is to use my skills and knowledge to make a positive impact in the technology industry. On my website, you can find more information about my background, my professional experience, and my current projects. Thank you for visiting, and I hope you find something of interest here.

Besides technology, I do ***enjoy*** movies, music, anime, and books like a
regular person, but won't even try to bring that up in a conversation unless
someone genuinely asks me to. But if you are interested, you can checkout my
recommendations bellow:

- [Anime](/anime/)  
- [Books](/book/)

<!-- ## *Software I use and recommend* -->
<!-- ### Priorities -->
<!-- The software should be as lightweight as possible and can be easily -->
<!-- customizeable, which means it is fast as fuck without compromising much. I  -->
<!-- dont care about flasy features or over the top design. I want a software -->
<!-- can transfer the things in my mind into some sort of file, without much  -->
<!-- hastle. -->

<!-- I like having vim/vim-like keybindings and prefer terminal program over -->
<!-- others. That said, I am not a "*terminal is cooler*" kid, that is just pure -->
<!-- cringe. There is somethings in my opinion ofc that graphical program does  -->
<!-- better than its terminal alternatives. -->

<!-- Anyways, here are the programs I use -->

<!-- **Operating System**   -->
<!-- In general I use [void linux](https://voidlinux.org), which is an -->
<!-- independent distrobution of -->
<!-- GNU/Linux. I like the runnit init system and the xbps package manager it -->
<!-- provides, its fast and minimal even on old hardware. -->


<!-- **Terminal**   -->
<!-- I use the [suckless terminal](https://st.suckless.org/) which is a very -->
<!-- minimal yet customizeable terminal emulator. It is simply the best for my use -->
<!-- case. -->


<!-- **Shell**   -->
<!-- I use dash and zsh on my machine, tho I write most of my shell scripts for  -->
<!-- POSIX complient shell I use zsh sometimes for its customizeablity although -->
<!-- I really hate the bloated 'oh-my-zsh' framework is utter garbage and a pure  -->
<!-- example of how not to write plugins/framework for something. -->


<!-- **Window Manager/Desktop Environment**   -->
<!-- I use suckless' [Dynamic Window Manager(DWM)](https://dwm.suckless.org) its a -->
<!-- extreamly lightweight and fast asf window manager. I prefer window managers  -->
<!-- over desktop environments cause all my needs are fulfilled by my dwm config. -->
<!-- I also use my own build of slstatus from the suckless guys as my status  -->
<!-- manager. -->


<!-- **IDE/Text Editor**   -->
<!-- I use Neovim, although I used to use just vim but I really like the native  -->
<!-- lua support that Neovim provides out of the box and also the auto completion -->
<!-- LSP support. Tho I know my neovim config is a bit bloated with all the plugins -->
<!-- I use but I have to use some of it cause of my workflow. -->


<!-- **Web Browser**   -->
<!-- I use two browsers, I use librewolf as my main browser, and TOR for anything -->
<!-- I dont want people to know about. -->


<!-- **File Manager**   -->
<!-- I use lf file manager. It is a terminal based file manager that uses vim-like -->
<!-- keybindings. -->


<!-- **Music Player**   -->
<!-- I use ncmpcpp with mpd for anything audio related. -->


<!-- **Video Player**   -->
<!-- mpv is the best video player in my oppinion and you are an idiot if you say I  -->
<!-- am wrong. -->
