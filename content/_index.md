**B4UC** is an alias/project that provides information and services by
me alone, to learn more about me or how to get in touch with me,
visit [about](/about).
This website is a comfy/minimal/suckless project by me to showcase how you 
don't need quadrillion JavaScript modules, API's to run your website.

But anyways, I post re-formatted old books here, as well as write blogs
about different topics in life I come across, these are mostly tech
and philosophy based blogs but some times I can get political. You are
free to criticize my opinions in via any social media, or 
[email](mailto:b4uc@tuta.io) me your perspective about different matters
my mail is always open for some decent conversation. Other than that there is
no other ways of reaching out to me.

If you would like to help me keep this thing going you can give me some fake
internet money
