Tho these may not be all computer or tech related but would probably be a good read if you want to read something new.  

## Philosophical book
1. ***Thus spoke Zarathustra (Friedrich Nietzsche)***  
  One of many philosophical books I recommend everyone to give it a shot, these are in my opinion on of the most fun and 

2. ***Beyond Good and Evil (Friedrich Nietzsche)***  
  If you like *Thus spoke Zarathustra* you would definitely like this one, it's like a continuation of Nietzsche's philosophy.  

3. ***Meditation (Marcus Aurelius)***  
  This book is of the most mentioned stoic books a person can find and it fulfills all the hype it gets.

4. ***12 Rules For Life (Jordan B. Peterson)***  
  If you read books you should probably know about this.

## Technological Books
1. ***The C Programming Language (Brian W. Kernighan | Dennis M. Ritche)***  
  The C bible for new programmers, written by chads, it has everything that a person needs to get started for basic to intermediate C programming.
