## [Philosophical book](#Philocsophy)
1. [Thus spoke Zarathustra]()  
  One of many philosophical books I recommend everyone to give it a shot, these are in my opinion on of the most fun and 
2. [Beyond Good and Evil]()  
  If you like *Thus spoke Zarathustra* you would definitely like this one, it's like a continuation of Nietzsche's philosophy.
