## 2025-02-10: I hate frontend development  

<code>

I am currently working on a project that is somewhat of a full stack project and tbh I am not having much fun in the frontend part of the project.  

The more time I try to develop frontend components of the website the more I hate the concept of front end development. I mean WTF is even the point of making things have animation when all the user needs is information which can really served in a barebones black/white/blue website. The main point of a website is to be informational where a user can collect any sort of information he/she may like.  

Anyway, the thing I am enjoying is the backend.

This was a simple life update just for the lulz.
