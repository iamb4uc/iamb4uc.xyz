<div class='dsclmr'>This is a general public life update that I would like to keep writing everyday. I use bad words here so go away bitch.</div>

## 2025-02-10: I hate frontend development  

<code>

I am currently working on a project that is somewhat of a full stack project and tbh I am not having much fun in the frontend part of the project.  

The more time I try to develop frontend components of the website the more I hate the concept of front end development. I mean WTF is even the point of making things have animation when all the user needs is information which can really served in a barebones black/white/blue website. The main point of a website is to be informational where a user can collect any sort of information he/she may like.  

Anyway, the thing I am enjoying is the backend.

This was a simple life update just for the lulz.

## 2025-02-11: Writing unit tests sucks ass

<code>

Today, the whole day I worked for around 12hr searching the web and finding out ways to write good unit tests for Go and JavaScript. But man this thing sucks so bad. Since I don't like to use any LLM during any of my learning phase unless I am obligated to or cant find any solutions to. It has been tough. 

And about LLMs man these shits are like a weed infestation. Everywhere I go its all about AI this AI that. Bitch I know your whole identity is about AI but calm down all I need is to use the internet and live my life peacefully. I don't need LLMs to do some shit that's already available on the internet. Not only does it take away your privacy but also hangs itself as a leach and sucks all your potential out of you.

Anyway, I learnt that Unit tests and Test Driven Development sucks. Not that it is bad or anything, I hate writing tests before even starting out my actual project. It is boring. But I ain't a soy bitch to quit so gotta grind myself through these biyach.
